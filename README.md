Tested with Renoise 3.0.

Works with Guru 1.60.
http://www.renoise.com/tools/guru

Just drop the file into the "synthdefinitions" directory of Guru.

Features:

 - Supports almost all non-global parameters (around 720). All through sysex.
 - The current program in the synthetizer is synchronized to Renoise.
   That means that if you change of program on the synth, Renoise will
   show the program you changed to.
 - Supports feedback, so if you change the parameters on the synth
   or through another midi device, the parameter will change in Renoise.
